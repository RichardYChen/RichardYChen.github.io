	%abstract={This paper resolves a pivotal open problem on nonparametric inference for nonlinear functionals of volatility matrix. Multiple prominent statistical tasks can be formulated as functionals of volatility matrix, yet a unified statistical theory of general nonlinear functionals based on noisy data remains challenging and elusive. Nonetheless, this paper shows it can be achieved by combining the strengths of pre-averaging, jump truncation and nonlinearity bias correction. In light of general nonlinearity, bias correction beyond linear approximation becomes necessary. Resultant estimators are nonparametric and robust over a wide spectrum of stochastic models. Moreover, the estimators can be rate-optimal and stable central limit theorems are obtained. The proposed framework lends itself conveniently to uncertainty quantification and permits fully feasible inference. With strong theoretical guarantees, this paper provides an inferential foundation for a wealth of statistical methods for noisy high-frequency data, such as realized principal component analysis, continuous-time linear regression, realized Laplace transform, generalized method of integrated moments and specification tests, hence extends current application scopes to noisy data which is more prevalent in practice.},

	title={The Fourier transform method for volatility functional inference by asynchronous observations},
	journal={preprint},
	year={2019},
	volume={},
	number={},
	pages={},
	%abstract={We study the volatility functional inference by Fourier transforms. This spectral framework is advantageous in that it harnesses the power of harmonic analysis to handle missing data and asynchronous observations without any artificial time alignment nor data imputation. Under conditions, this spectral approach is consistent and we provide limit distributions using irregular and asynchronous observations. When observations are synchronous, the Fourier transform method for volatility functionals attains both the optimal convergence rate and the efficient bound in the sense of Le Cam and H\'ajek. Another finding is asynchronicity or missing data as a form of noise produces ``interference'' in the spectrum estimation and impacts on the convergence rate of volatility functional estimators. This new methodology extends previous applications of volatility functionals, including principal component analysis, generalized method of moments, continuous-time linear regression models et cetera, to high-frequency datasets of which asynchronicity is a prevalent feature.},

	%abstract={This paper presents the nonparametric inference for nonlinear volatility functionals of general multivariate It\^o semimartingales, in high-frequency and noisy setting. Pre-averaging and truncation enable simultaneous handling of noise and jumps. Second-order expansion reveals explicit biases and a pathway to bias correction. Estimators based on this framework achieve the optimal convergence rate. A class of stable central limit theorems are attained with estimable asymptotic covariance matrices. This paper form a basis for infill asymptotic results of, for example, the realized Laplace transform, the realized principal component analysis, the continuous-time linear regression, and the generalized method of integrated moments, hence helps to extend the application scopes to more frequently sampled noisy data.},

	title={Model-free approaches to discern non-stationary market microstructure noise and time-varying liquidity in high-frequency data},
	journal={Journal of Econometrics},
	year={2017},
	volume={200},
	number={},
	pages={79-103},
	%abstract={In this paper, we provide non-parametric statistical tools to test stationarity of microstructure noise in general hidden It\^o semimartingales, and discuss how to measure liquidity risk using high-frequency financial data. In particular, we investigate the impact of non-stationary microstructure noise on some volatility estimators, and design three complementary tests by exploiting edge effects, information aggregation of local estimates and high-frequency asymptotic approximation. The asymptotic distributions of these tests are available under both stationary and non-stationary assumptions, thereby enable us to conservatively control type-I errors and meanwhile ensure the proposed tests enjoy the asymptotically optimal statistical power. Besides it also enables us to empirically measure aggregate liquidity risks by these test statistics. As byproducts, functional dependence and endogenous microstructure noise are briefly discussed. Simulation with a realistic configuration corroborates our theoretical results, and our empirical study indicates the prevalence of non-stationary microstructure noise in New York Stock Exchange.},
